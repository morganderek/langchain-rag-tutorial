## Key Features

**Its Aims**

y To allow you to choose from a range of funds,
including exchange traded funds (ETFs), for
investment.

y To meet your investment objectives – giving you
the opportunity for capital growth, income, or a
combination of both.

y To provide flexible, tax-efficient investment through
an ISA (or Junior ISA).

y To give you access to your savings by paying you an
income or by facilitating withdrawals.

```
Your Commitment
y To satisfy the minimum initial investment or the
minimum monthly payment for regular investors.
```
```
y To observe the annual subscription limit across all
your ISAs if you invest through a Vanguard ISA.
Failure to comply with this requirement may render
your ISA void.
```
```
y You should be prepared to invest for the medium to
long term, meaning at least five years normally and
generally for a longer period.
```
```
y You must notify us of a change of address or of
any other important changes to your personal
details (or to those of the beneficiary in the case of
a Junior ISA) or changes to your payment details
(i.e. cancellation of direct debits). Please note that,
if you move abroad, we reserve the right to place
restrictions on your account. This may mean that you
are prevented from making additional investments
or switching existing holdings into other funds. If
required to do so, we may also inform any relevant
foreign authority about your investments.
```
```
Please see the “Questions and Answers” section below
for details of the minimum investment conditions and
HMRC subscription limits for ISAs.
```

## Risks

**General investment risks**

It is important to understand the risks before investing
in any fund. All investments involve some degree of risk.
Some of the risks involved are described below.

What you get back depends on how your investments
perform, the charges which are made, and any other
deductions. The performance of investment funds is
not guaranteed, and past performance is not a reliable
indicator of future results. The value of investments,
and the income from them, can fall as well as rise. You
may get back less than you invest.

Any money which you hold as cash within your
Vanguard ISA or Vanguard General Account will not
benefit from any market appreciation.

Inflation will affect the real value of your investments
(including any cash) in the future. If the growth of
your investments (after the deduction of charges) is
lower than the rate of inflation, the real value of your
investments will be reduced over time.

Although Vanguard is committed to low-cost investing,
fund charges can vary and may increase, and these
will reduce the potential for growth and / or income.
Also, if you choose to take income or make lump sum
withdrawals from your investments, or if you sell fund
shares to pay account charges, these deductions will
reduce the capital value of your investments over time.

Levels of tax and available tax reliefs may change
in the future. Any tax benefits are subject to your
individual circumstances.

```
Specific risk factors for funds
Investment funds carry certain risks which are specific
to their objectives and the management of their assets.
```
```
For information on a fund’s investment objective and
policy, and the risks, please refer to the relevant Key
Investor Information Document (“KIID”) and Prospectus.
These documents are available from Vanguard via this
website (www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk).
```
```
You are responsible for evaluating the risks associated
with investing in any fund. The investment products
offered on this website are intended generally for
retail clients but may not be suitable for all investors.
Further information regarding the target market for
each fund is available on our website. If you are unsure
of the implications or of the suitability for you of a
particular fund, you should obtain personal advice from
an authorised financial adviser.
```

## Questions and Answers

**What is the Vanguard ISA?**

An ISA is a type of product wrapper, or account, which
is used to hold investments in a tax-efficient way. It is
not itself an investment. There is an annual subscription
limit across all your ISAs set by the Government which
can be found on our website.

The Vanguard ISA is a “stocks and shares ISA”, which
allows you to invest in our range of funds. We do not
offer a “cash ISA” (a different type of ISA which holds
investors’ money in cash products), although the cash
component within our stocks and shares ISA permits
you to shelter money as cash when desired.

The Vanguard ISA is a “flexible” ISA, meaning that
money you withdraw may generally be paid back in
during the same tax year without counting towards
your annual allowance (see also “Can I withdraw my
money?” below).

In addition, the Vanguard Junior ISA allows you to
invest separately on behalf of a child, subject to a
lower annual subscription limit which can be found on
our website. Anyone may contribute to the account
on the child’s behalf, such as grandparents and other
relatives. When the child for whom a Junior ISA is
opened reaches age 18, it automatically converts into a
Vanguard ISA held in their own name. References in this
document to the Vanguard ISA generally also include
the Vanguard Junior ISA, unless stated.

**What is the Vanguard General**

**Account?**

The Vanguard General Account is used to hold
investments outside of an ISA. It is typically used by
individuals who have already invested their full annual
ISA subscription allowance. There are no investment
limits. The Vanguard General Account does not benefit
from the tax advantages conferred upon ISAs.

**Who can open an account?**

Both the Vanguard ISA and the Vanguard General
Account are generally available to individual applicants
aged 18 or over who reside in the UK and pay tax in the
UK (and in the case of the Vanguard General Account
pay tax in the UK only). The products and services are
not available to US persons. Joint name accounts are
not permitted.

A parent or legal guardian may open a Vanguard Junior
ISA for a child under 18 who is resident in the UK and
is not already the beneficiary of a Child Trust Fund or
Stocks and Shares Junior ISA. The person who opens

```
the Junior ISA will be the “registered contact” for
legal purposes and will be responsible for making the
investment decisions and managing the account until
the child reaches 18 and the Junior ISA converts into an
ISA. At that time the former child beneficiary becomes
entitled to manage the investments as the holder of
the ISA.
```
```
You must have a UK bank account, as defined in the
Vanguard Client Terms, in order to open a Vanguard
account.
```
```
Which funds are available?
We offer a wide range of Vanguard mutual funds
and exchange traded funds (ETFs), so that you can
invest according to your individual needs. Within
each fund, investors’ money is pooled to purchase a
diversified portfolio which may include shares, bonds
and other securities, depending on the individual fund’s
investment objective and policy. Many of the funds
aim to replicate the performance of a particular index
of securities (these are known as “index” or “tracker”
funds), but funds which pursue an actively-managed
investment strategy are also available, together with
certain “funds of funds” which themselves invest in
other Vanguard funds.
```
```
The following different types of fund are available:
```
```
y Open-ended investment companies (OEICs) and
authorised unit trusts are UK-based products
regulated by the FCA.
```
```
y Certain funds are domiciled in Ireland. These include
funds which are structured like the UK OEICs, as
well as ETFs. ETFs have some unique characteristics,
and are traded like stocks on a stock exchange.
Vanguard’s Irish funds are regulated by the Central
Bank of Ireland and recognised by the FCA for
distribution in the UK.
```
```
Can I hold cash in my account?
Yes, you may hold cash in both the Vanguard ISA and
the Vanguard General Account – while you decide
where to invest, for example, or to pay charges. Cash
held in your account will be out of the market and so
will not benefit from any market growth whilst not
invested.
```
```
We will deposit any cash you pay us in one or more
trust accounts with one or more authorised banks.
You may earn a rate of interest on cash as described in
Vanguard’s Client Terms.
```

**How do I open an account?**

You must open your account online. Please have your
National Insurance Number to hand.

Before opening your account, you should carefully read
these Key Features, the Legal Information, our Privacy
Policy, and Vanguard’s Client Terms (which you must
accept in order to open an account). You will also be
asked to confirm your nationality and to the extent
you are a non-UK national or have dual nationality you
will be required to provide details of your passport (or
such other form of national identification as may be
acceptable to us to verify your nationality).

**How do I invest?**

When you have decided which fund(s) you wish to invest
in, you may make a lump sum payment electronically
using a UK bank debit card or (for larger payments
exceeding £50,000) by a direct credit transfer from a
UK bank account. We do not accept payments made
from pre-paid cards, credit cards, cheque or through
other types of payment provider.

We will not complete your investment order(s) before
we receive payment in full from you. Payments made
by direct credit transfer may not be received by us as
cleared funds for up to two Business Days.

If you wish to invest on a monthly basis you may set
up a regular savings plan by completing a direct debit
mandate linked to your bank account. We will notify
you when the payments will be collected. Your monthly
subscription may be increased, reduced (subject to the
minimum payment requirement) or stopped by you at
any time, although it may not be possible to implement
your instructions until after the next collection date.
Please note that, if you redeem or switch your holding
of shares in a fund into which you are investing under
a regular savings plan, your subscriptions will continue
until you instruct otherwise.

All investments must be made in pounds sterling.

**Can I transfer existing ISAs and**

**investments to Vanguard?**

Yes, generally this is possible as confirmed during
the online application process and explained further
below. In most cases, you should be able to transfer
any existing holdings in Vanguard funds to us without
needing first to convert them to cash (a direct transfer
facility sometimes called “re-registration”). Please
note that, if you wish to transfer Vanguard fund
holdings to us from an account currently held with
another provider, all such Vanguard fund holdings will
be transferred.

```
Transfers of ISAs and Junior ISAs
If you have previously opened any ISAs or Junior ISAs
with other ISA managers, you can ask for these to be
transferred to Vanguard without losing any accrued tax
benefits. Please note that the value of an ISA opened
during the current tax year must be transferred in
full, and Junior ISAs must always be fully transferred
(whenever opened).
```
```
As noted above, Vanguard fund holdings within
an existing ISA can be transferred directly to your
Vanguard ISA if we offer the fund(s) on the Vanguard
platform. If you wish to transfer an existing holding in a
non-Vanguard fund (or in a Vanguard fund which we do
not make available on our platform), it will first be sold
by your current ISA manager so that the cash proceeds
(after deducting any charges due to the existing
manager) can be transferred to your Vanguard ISA. This
money will then be held as cash pending your choice of
a new fund investment. Please note that, if you make
a transfer in cash, you will not benefit from any rise in
value of investments while your money is not invested.
```
```
General Account Transfers
In the case of non-ISA investments, any shares in a
Vanguard fund which you have previously bought either
directly from Vanguard or from another provider can
be transferred directly to your online Vanguard General
Account if supported on the Vanguard platform.
```
```
Please note that these processes may be limited or
restricted by your current account provider, and you
may be charged by them for transfers out of such
accounts.
```
```
For more information about transferring existing
investments to Vanguard, please visit http://www.
vanguardinvestor.co.uk. This includes details of the
Vanguard funds which are eligible for direct transfer to
our platform.
```
```
What is the minimum investment?
Your initial lump sum payment (or transfer value)
should be at least £500 for each fund which you
choose. The minimum payment under a monthly
savings plan should be £100 per fund.
```
```
What is the maximum investment?
There is no overall investment limit. However, if you
are investing in a Vanguard ISA or Junior ISA, HMRC’s
annual subscription limits apply. The current limits can
be found on our website.
```
```
There is no limit if you are investing through the
Vanguard General Account.
```

**How are funds priced?**

All funds are normally priced on each Business Day,
at the applicable pricing point. When you buy or sell
investments, the transaction will be carried out at the
price which is calculated (based on the valuation of the
fund) at the next fund pricing point.

Please note that shares in ETFs are listed on the
London Stock Exchange, and their price is affected by
supply and demand during the trading day. Normally,
ETF trades will be placed at or shortly after the
next dealing point (10.15am or 2.10pm), free of any
brokerage charge. Alternatively, you may opt to use
our quote and deal service to trade at a market quoted
price. This service carries a charge of £7.50 per trade.

For more information about fund pricing, please visit
[http://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk.](http://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk.) In addition, the Order
Execution Policy (a summary of which is appended to
Vanguard’s Client Terms) describes how we deliver the
best possible result for you when dealing in investments
for you.

**What documentation will I receive?**

It is a feature of Vanguard’s personal investor service
that we will only issue documents online, and you
consent to this by accepting Vanguard’s Client Terms.
You may of course download or print any items which
you wish to retain in hard copy form.

We will provide you with a confirmation of transaction
for each new investment instruction which you place.
These documents will be stored in the documents
library on your account.

At least once every quarter, we will provide you with
a summary statement and valuation of your account
investments, and this will confirm all the investment
transactions which you have made since the previous
statement. You may log in to your account at any time
for a current valuation of your holdings.

We will also provide you with an annual statement detailing
the actual costs and charges which your account and
the investments in it have incurred during the preceding
year. If you have a Vanguard General Account we will also
provide tax vouchers on an annual basis corresponding
to the previous tax year. We will not provide you with
Capital Gains Tax calculations on your Vanguard
General Account.

We will also disclose details of our relevant policies
to you on our website, including summaries of our
Conflicts of Interest Policy and Order Execution Policy
which appear in Vanguard’s Client Terms.

You can ask us for further information about our
policies and services at any time.

```
You are also entitled to ask us for copies of certain
telephone calls and electronic communications which
relate to or are intended to lead to the conclusion of an
order, as explained in Vanguard’s Client Terms.
```
```
Can I change my mind? What are my
cancellation rights?
Yes – you may cancel your Vanguard ISA or JISA by
informing us in writing via secure message within 14
days from the date we served you with cancellation
rights, normally this will be the date when the account
was opened. The cancellation amount will be equal
to the value of any Payments made prior to the
cancellation or value of your investments at the time
Vanguard sells them, whichever is lower. Product
charges will also apply until the account is closed, and
charges which have already been deducted will not
be refunded.
```
```
If you cancel an ISA or Junior ISA within the cancellation
period, it is treated as not having been opened and so you
can apply to open another one during the same tax year.
```
```
After the 14 day cancellation period expires, you
may withdraw your money at any time by selling or
transferring your investments (see further below).
```
```
How do I switch investments?
You can switch between funds in your account at any
time. We do not charge for switching but you may incur
an entry charge when switching into certain funds
(see “Fund charges” under “What costs and charges
will I pay?” below). When you instruct a switch, we
sell existing investments and use the proceeds to buy
the substitute investment. Switch transactions are
normally processed over the course of four business
days to enable settlement of both the sell and buy
transactions.
```
```
How will my investments be held?
We will register your fund holdings in the name of a
Vanguard nominee company (Vanguard UK Nominees
Limited), which will hold them on your behalf. You will
remain the beneficial owner.
```
```
Can I choose to take income?
Yes, there are two ways in which you may do so.
First, you should elect to invest in the income share
class of a fund, where available, if you wish to receive
income distributed periodically from the fund into your
nominated bank account. Unless you do so, you will
invest in the accumulation share class.
```
```
Alternatively, you may set up a regular withdrawal plan,
as described below (see “Can I withdraw my money?”).
```

**Can I withdraw my money?**

Generally, you can take money out of your account at
any time without charge, but withdrawals will reduce
capital growth and income potential. Please note
that withdrawals may not be made from a Junior ISA
until the child reaches the age of 18 and becomes the
account holder (except in the event of their terminal
illness or death).

The Vanguard ISA is a “flexible” ISA, which means
that, while it remains open (and subject to certain
exceptions noted in Vanguard’s Client Terms), money
you withdraw may be paid back in during the same
tax year without counting towards your annual ISA
allowance. A payment into your ISA will first be treated
as a repayment of a previous withdrawal in the same
tax year, if applicable.

You may make one-off withdrawals from time to
time, or you can set up a plan to withdraw money on
a regular basis (monthly, quarterly, twice-yearly, or
annually). There is no minimum withdrawal amount
and no requirement to maintain a minimum account
balance. These instructions can be varied or cancelled
at any time. We will sell investments for you and pay
the money directly to your nominated bank account
once we receive it from the relevant fund manager.

**What costs and charges will I pay?**

Vanguard is committed to keeping costs low for all
investors. The charges set out below may apply to your
account as a personal investor. Further information is
also provided under the heading “How will costs and
charges affect my investment?” below.

**Fund charges**

These are set by Vanguard and apply at the level of
the particular fund(s) in which you invest and are also
referred to as fund management costs.

The ongoing charges figure (OCF) is expressed as an
annual percentage of the value of a fund, and includes
Vanguard’s charge for managing the fund and its
assets as well as administrative expenses such as the
fees of the independent custodian, the registrar, the
fund auditor and other regulatory expenses. Please
refer to the specific Key Investor Information Document
(KIID) for details of the OCF applicable to a fund which
you choose.

In addition, the funds incur transaction costs (including
when buying and selling underlying investments) and
other incidental costs. These costs are included within
the estimate of costs and charges disclosure provided
as described under the heading “How will costs and
charges affect my investment?” below.

```
Vanguard account fee
This is what you pay in return for the provision of
account services. These services include the fund
dealing facility, the recording of transactions and
holdings, the safeguarding of your investments by our
nominee, and other ancillary services. These comprise
certain online services as well as the provision of access
to our personal investor service representatives.
```
```
The account fee is an annual charge which we accrue
daily and deduct proportionately in arrears on a
quarterly basis commencing three months after the
earlier of (i) the date of your first investment; or the
opening of your Account where you have instructed a
transfer or regular monthly savings plan. The amount
which you pay is based on the overall value of your
Vanguard personal investor account, excluding any cash
held. The rate of charge is 0.15% per annum of the value
of your account holdings up to £250,000, such that the
maximum annual charge is £375.
```
```
You have the option, when you open your account or
at any later time, to arrange payment of your account
fee by direct debit from your nominated bank account.
Alternatively, we will deduct the fee from available
cash (and, failing that, from fund holdings) within your
account in accordance with the disinvestment strategy
set out in Vanguard’s Client Terms. This prioritises
collection of charges from your General Account, in
order to maximise your ISA tax benefits.
```
```
Transaction fees
If you buy or sell an ETF through our optional quote and
deal service, we will deduct a fixed charge of £7.50 to
cover the fee of our nominated stockbroker.
```
```
Payments made to you via CHAPS at your request will
be charged at the rate of £25 per payment.
```
```
Interest on cash
Interest will be earned on cash balances at a managed
rate, meaning that it will be fixed and updated from
time to time. The rate will be determined by reference
to the interest we receive from the bank(s) we deposit
your money with and the cost to us of managing cash
within your account. We will retain any extra interest we
receive on your cash above the stated rate to cover the
costs of managing it (for example, the costs associated
with our banking arrangements) and to enable us to
continue to develop our products and services. Further
information on how we manage your cash, including
the applicable interest rates and how your cash is
protected can be found here.
```
```
In the event that we are not able to sufficiently recover
our costs from the interest we receive we reserve the
right to levy an additional service fee by written notice
as set out in the Vanguard Client Terms.
```
```
We will let you know if this changes in the future.
```

**How will costs and charges affect my**

**investment?**

What you get back will depend on the performance
of the fund(s) in which you invest and the impact of
charges and other deductions, including any income
which is paid out. Performance cannot be guaranteed.

An estimate of the effect of costs and charges is
provided when you invest a lump sum in any fund or,
in the case of a regular savings plan, when you set it
up. Each year you will receive a statement setting out
the costs and charges which you actually incurred in
the previous year and their impact on the value of your
fund investments.

**What are the tax implications?**

The amount of tax which you will pay depends on
your personal circumstances. UK residents and UK-
domiciled funds are subject to the UK tax regime. Funds
domiciled in Ireland are subject to the tax rules of that
jurisdiction, but UK tax applies to any capital gains and
income which UK residents receive from them.

The tax information provided below is based on our
understanding of current UK tax legislation and HMRC
practice, which may change in the future. If you are in
any doubt about the implications of buying, holding
or selling an investment, you should speak to an
independent adviser.

**Tax and ISAs / Junior ISAs**

You are not liable to pay tax on any income or capital
gains arising from your ISA investments, and such
amounts do not need to be declared on your tax return.
If any basic rate UK income tax has been deducted
from income or interest distributions, we will claim it
back from HMRC on your behalf and add it to your ISA.

**Tax and General Account holdings**

Income and capital gains should be declared on your
tax return. We will provide you with a consolidated tax
voucher to assist you with your income declaration. If
you invest in a fund which is domiciled in Ireland, you
should also refer to the periodic reports published after
the fund’s year end for details of the excess income to
declare on your tax return.

Any sale of shares, including a switch, could give rise to
a capital gains tax liability.

```
Can I transfer my investments to
another account provider?
Yes, you may arrange for an alternative platform
provider or ISA manager to take over the
administration of the investments which you hold with
Vanguard. Investments will be sold for transfer as cash,
or it may be possible to have them transferred directly
if this is supported by your new account provider.
```
```
What happens to my account
investments if I die?
Generally, your money will remain invested as at the
time of your death. The investments and any cash will
then form part of your estate. All applicable charges
will continue to be deducted, and the value of your
investments will rise and fall in the normal course. We
will, however, cease to collect any further direct debits
if you were investing under a regular savings plan, and
we will cancel any regular withdrawal facility which you
may have set up.
```
```
In the case of an ISA, your tax advantages will
continue to apply after your death, in accordance
with HMRC rules for a period of up to 3 years. No
further subscriptions can be accepted. Holdings in your
Vanguard ISA will be moved into a Vanguard General
Account in your name. If you have a surviving spouse or
civil partner, they may be eligible to receive a one-off
additional ISA allowance equivalent to the value of your
ISA at the time of death, or at the point when the ISA
loses its tax advantages.
```
```
Once we have completed all necessary formalities with
the person(s) responsible for administering your estate
(your personal representative(s)), we will provide a
final value of your investments and transfer over the
proceeds realised from their sale. Alternatively, if so
instructed, we may directly transfer your investments
to be held in someone else’s name.
```
